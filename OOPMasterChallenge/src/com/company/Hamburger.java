// We want to create a base hamburger, but also two other types of hamburgers that are popular ones in Bill's store.
// The basic hamburger should have the following items:
// Bread roll type, meat and up to 4 additional additions (things like lettuce, tomato, carrot, etc) that
// the customer can select to be added to the burger.
// Each one of these items gets charged an additional price so you need some way to track how many items got added
// and to calculate the final price (base burger with all the additions).
// This burger has a base price and the additions are all separately priced (up to 4 additions, see above).
// Create a Hamburger class to deal with all the above.
// The constructor should only include the roll type, meat and price, can also include the name of the burger or you can use a setter.
